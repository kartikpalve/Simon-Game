Simon Says: A Classic Memory Game
This is a basic README for the Simon Game.

What is it ?
Simon Says is a classic electronic memory game where a sequence of colored buttons is displayed to the player. The player needs to repeat the sequence 
by pressing the buttons in the correct order. As the player progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging.

How to Play :
Start the game: The game will typically begin with a short sequence of button flashes. Pay close attention!
Repeat the sequence: Once the sequence is complete, it's your turn. Press the buttons in the same order they flashed.
Progress or penalty: If you press the buttons correctly, the game will congratulate you and display a longer sequence. If you make a mistake, the game 
will end, and you might need to restart.
Challenge yourself: As you progress through the levels, the sequences will become longer and more complex. Keep your focus and memory sharp!

To be implemented :
High score tracking
Different effects for each button on pressed


Enjoy the game!




Tasks to be done in future are :
1) Theme Modes – Add dark mode or fun themes (retro, sci-fi).
2) Reverse/Speed Mode – Reverse pattern or make it faster as levels increase.
3) Multiplayer – One player creates, another copies.
4) Custom Sounds – Let users record or choose sounds.
5) Leaderboards – Track high scores with localStorage or Firebase.
6) Power-ups – Add lives, slow-motion, or replay options.
7) Visual Effects – Use cool animations or circular button layout.
8) Scramble Mode – Buttons shuffle position after showing pattern.
